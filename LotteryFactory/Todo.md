**Overall development Plan**
* Create something that works locally first. 
* Use docker for app and nosql (instance based) for database.
* Don't do docker development from start. 
* Tasks have to be small enough.
* Automate on what is needed.
* Don't do upfront infrastructure development.

**Questions**
* What are the benefits of sealed traits ?
* Copy constructor in Scala ?

**Intention**
* The more you stay on the site and explore ads, the more you earn.
* Lottery every day based on revenue earned.
* Lottery should be given out to only those people that have registered.
* If you register and are not online, you don't get the lottery.
